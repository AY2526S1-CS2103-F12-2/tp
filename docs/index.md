**DevBooks is a desktop application for managing your contact details blazing-fast.**

While it has a GUI, users interface with DevBooks primarily through their *keyboards* - navigation can be done purely through vim-like bindings, and operations are done a CLI interface.

* Sounds interesting? Check out the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start). Or just dive right in and [download a DevBooks release now](https://github.com/AY2526S1-CS2103-F12-2/tp/releases)!
