### Project: DevBooks

DevBooks is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

Added multiple UI/UX related features:
* Modal Keyboard Navigation
* Autocompletion hints & fill
* Saved and Accessible Command History

Additionally, for Logic:
* Added State component for Confirming/Denying clear/delete commands

For DevOps and Testing:
* Introduced TestFX into app for headlessly performing UI tests
* Updated CI workflows to have cross-platform UI testing working well

And for the overall application:
* Made Status Bar accessible to use for warning messages, specifically for loading corrupted data
