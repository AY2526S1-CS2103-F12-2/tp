### Project: DevBooks

DevBooks provides fast digital access to students in National University of Singapore, School of Computing, making it easier to contact any student using their preferred mode of communication. Allow students to find project mates from the same project group easily and view the development profile of their contact.

Given below are my contributions to the project:

Added multiple UI/UX related features:
* Modal Keyboard Navigation
* Autocompletion hints & fill
* Saved and Accessible Command History

Additionally, for Logic:
* Added State component for Confirming/Denying clear/delete commands

For DevOps and Testing:
* Introduced TestFX into app for headlessly performing UI tests
* Updated CI workflows to have cross-platform UI testing working well

And for the overall application:
* Made Status Bar accessible to use for warning messages, specifically for loading corrupted data
