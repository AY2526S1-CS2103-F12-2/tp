### Project: DevBooks

DevBooks provides fast digital access to students in National University of Singapore, School of Computing, making it easier to contact any student using their preferred mode of communication. Allow students to find project mates from the same project group easily and view the development profile of their contact.

**Feature Enhancements**:
* Updated Edit Feature:
    * Remove volatile add/removing of tags
* Enhanced List Feature:
    * Added sorting feature by alphabetical/recent order

New Features:
* Launch Feature:
    * Allows launching of communication mode.
* Rename Tag
    * Allows mass editing of tags for multiple users in the displayed list

Testing:
* Introduced `Mockito` as a test dependency mock Desktop behaviour by facilitating unit testing of system-level interaction
  This allows my newly added test cases to simulate success and failure of the ApplicationLinkLauncher without having to actually open the browser or mail application for testing.
